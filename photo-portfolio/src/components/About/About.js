              <p>
                Welcome to my photography portfolio.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm Aniruddha Oka, a passionate photographer who loves to capture life's most beautiful moments as I witness them.
              </p>
              <p>
                And this is the very reason that I have been shooting on my iPhone Pro off late, having practiced photography on an SLR with a set of lenses.
              </p>
              <p>
                With an eye for detail and a love for storytelling, I believe I have a collection of various photographs mostly including Natural Landscapes, Skies, Flowers & Fauna, Walking Trails and some interesting images and scenery that fascinated me. Mostly in colour and select few in Monotone â€“ Black & White that is.
              </p>
              <p>
                To me, each photograph tells a story of a unique moment frozen in time that I cherish.
              </p>
              <p>
                And without being selfish, I wish to share the joy of witnessing these moments now with you. Be it grandeur of nature, the play of light & shadow, the spontaneity of candid moments or the interesting shapes & patterns.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope you do like some of these and if you wish to have some printed or framed, do get in touch with me.
              </p>
